I think there has to be more clear explanation where to send results from QA assignment.


Description of the app:
Application is meant to calculate cost of parking with ability to select type of parking and time and date ranges for parking.


Features proposals list:
1. Ability to select current date and time in date and time fields.

2. Ability to remember 'Choose a Lot' dropdown state in cookies.

3. Transform date and time text fields into more suitable - like for example on this page - http://www.html5tutorial.info/html5-date.php - in '5. Date and Time (<input type="datetime"/>)' section - cause there are a lot of bugs with this type of field - like:
	1) you can enter time in incorrect format;
	2) more than 12 hours can be entered in time fields;
	3) more than 60 minutes can be entered in time fields;
	4) incorrect date can be entered - like '2/30/2017';
	5) almost anything can be entered in date and time fields - like 0, 1, 999999999 (which cause hanging of the site), non-digit symbols;
	6) both entry and leaving date fields are permitting to enter date before current date;
	7) both entry and leaving time fields are permitting to enter time before current time.
	
4. Entry date and time could be prefilled with current date and time.

5. There can be quick date/time shifters in form - like calculate for +1 hour + 30 min + 2 hours + 15 min.

6. If user firstly selects entry date/time - leaving date/time should start from entry date/time.

7. Remember states for 'AM' and 'PM' radio buttons and 'Choose a Lot' dropdown after pressing 'Calculate' button (date/time values are remembered).

8. Change style of line under 'PARKING CALCULATOR' - to match styling of other lines on page - screenshot - https://www.dropbox.com/s/8h534ni1arkkguo/change-style-of-line.png?dl=0 .

9. Display more descriptive error messages in 'COST' field and highlight errors in in form feilds.

10. If user selects less then one hour date/time range - hint user with explanations that cost is displaying for one hour - not for selected minutes or display question mark near 'COST' field text with explanations after hovering/clicking on it.

11. Add favicon.

12. Focus 'Choose a Lot' dropdown on site loading - for quicker keyboard navigation.


Bugs:
1. 404 error for http://adam.goucher.ca/parkcalc/NavImages/spacer.gif file in site resources.

2. Inconsistent naming of fields names in 'COST' error message - screenshot - https://www.dropbox.com/s/adh7qe8kwtdpx09/inconsistent-naming-of-fields-names.png?dl=0 .
