live:
26. Ability to boot in text mode from syslinux on live sys (and from grub on installed system?). ??
27. Add secondary keyboard layout into live sys (along with english and english by default) that was chosen in syslinux (F2) and on installed sys (lang chosen in calamares). ??
5. Launch full-fledged 'System Monitor' (KSysGuard) on Ctrl + Esc shortcut instead of stripped-down 'System Activity'.???

8. Add fastest mirror detection and synchronizing of databases upon connecting to internet. ???
12. Integrate Variety app - change wallpaper once a day (in addition to 'Picture of the Day' Wallpaper functionality) - preconfigure for anonimous login and select image sources like - nature - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/37 , digital art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/479 , fantasy art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/853 . It would be great to have different wallpapers on all Nerunner installations (with default wallpaper when offline or on first day), http://peterlevi.com/variety/2014/05/variety-and-kde/ , https://answers.launchpad.net/variety/+question/268006 . ????
9. Minor - kde system settings package without classic tree view option (like in calculate linux kde). ??

suggestion vision of a perfect distro - wishlist
i suggest here in comments add your thougts of what will make a perfect distro
checklist from other distros pros and cons
use blue theme bluex instead of dark brown/grey/blue by default - task switcher is using bluex theme already
OpenRC version.
6. Idea for disabling internal update checking/notification of all apps.
15. Develop Nurunner Tweaks app (like Lite Tweaks in Lite Linux) - for apps tweaks (and use kaptan for kde tweaks) - or all-in-one Nurunner Control Center with welcome screen.
advertize android development, gaming, QPhotoRec Qt5 GUI - alternative to Recuva etc. on main site + commercial support + buy subcription??
4. Build server for nightly isos, dev/git/AUR packages.
6. Think about more additional nurunner configurations (better plasma integrations, patches etc.) for some applications that can be installed separately (or as dependency, or in meta package). configuration for popular apps??
7. Idea - make installing apps in more assisted mode. For example you install plex-media-server and you see more tips in console, running plex server interface auto opens in default browser after installing.??
9. disable border in main panel and in GTK3 CSDs - for faster selection of apps with moving cursor to the most left position of app icon - for less congnitive load of more precise select of apps icon - for faster closing minimizing maximizing GTK3 windows without precise selection of buttons - for faster selection of window buttons with moving cursor to the most top position of GTK3 app window buttons
- sell t-shorts, cups, mobile straps?


11. Set middle mouse click on desktop to 'Switch Window' action by default
Right click on desktop -> Configure Desktop -> Mouse Actions -> Middle-Button -> Switch Window dropdown
This will ease of switching between numerous application on more than one virtual desktop. ??

[Suggestion] Tweak Dolphin
   'Details' view mode with added 'Type' column,
    22px icons size
    bottom right slider screenshot +  + disable preview + show full path + dolphin enable more root actions dropbox services in options??
Various gadget to work greatly with netrunner - fitbit, nest...
5) better integration with various (sport, iot) gadgets, sport bands, watches
