I tested ~10 installs with localizations/regions and in one install i saw this issue with lists






















discover:
if there is update from flatpak firefox it's displayed as one update of selecting updates page - other updates are displayed

updates partial shows first time then flashes and shows second time list updates page

other package manager update pamac rolling - discover tray icon update after timeout? 

increasing width middle apps list revealing animation should

is there some interval on checking updates if there are currentl not updated updates list?

add fade in or slide animation when selecting apps/addons in categories when selec0ting particlar app













add source button for flatrepo and flatpak links adding shows double entries in flathub source list - maybe use '--if-not-exists' option for internal flatpak command - clicking on install button on double entry app from flatref shows that it's already installed

supertuxcart reviews 8 aren't scrollable by touchpad 1080p screen bottom default sized panel fullscreen discover window
 
hover tooltip for top right app/addons sort order dropdown can be more informative sort: rating -> Sort by user ratings

if there are no deps - don't display 'Show deps' link - if there are no deps - for example 'libkf5idletime5' package 'libkf5purpose5'

possibly somehow mark autoselected checkboxes in when changing checkboxes in updates page - for example latte -> latte plasmoid _> latte shell

gpl v2 licence in about page opens text that cannot scroll page with touchscreen or even open it in browser same as licences in app info

add circle arrows when checking for updaates adn up arrow when updates are in progreess tray icon

wish - after updates - 'no updates' text could be like 'update successful' and if plasma components was update this text could be complemented with 'restart computer to apply updates'



should not as for password if 'dependency resolution failed'


no transaction canceled for flatpak pack



pass prompt for flatpak packages?


fade effect after cancel of transaction install remove


when other process is installing packages (command line) - after pressing 'install' button - discover prompts for pass, shows installing progress and then shows 'remove' button - but package isn't installed - though the 'update' section displays 'cannot obtain lock' error message


not interrupting logout/restart upon updates?

fetching updates without progress if prev update process was interrupted? - after timeout 'the system is up to date' wrong message

how good discover is in tolerating of connection interruption?

no Transaction canceled for flathub packages?

9 test when in updates window and new updates arrived - without installing prev update - how would app behaves?


don't display launch button for plasma addons apps

Display warning message for 'News' tabs if there was some kind of error??
ability to stop syncronizing database in Output tab - there may be some edge cases when program is not progressing from 'Synchronizing databases...' message

[Suggestion] Use Polkit instead of gksu/kdesu??
KDE su (5.36) hangs after entering wrong/empty password with very long responce delay. Related upstream bug - https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=292176 and somehow - https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=377528  ??

bundle dropbox when it will be available in repo (and in live sys) with dropbox-plasma-dark-icons package + add it to repo + add dropbox-plasma-light-icons package into repo too - cause default dropbox icon is pixelated in sys tray (for me).??

Disable all system sounds by default??
The case for this is let's say users is listening music/audiobook while making some activity - notifications sounds may annoy them???
12. No entry for 'Plasma Services' upon search in 'Application Menu'??
21. Review 'Plasma Search' KRunner plugins - do we need for example 'Activities', 'Date and Time', 'Dictionary', 'Instant Messaging', 'OpenStreetMap with Marble', 'Unit Converter' and 'Web Shortcuts' + screenshots???

display 'Open File - ISO Image Writer' popup file selection dialog on program startup??
kingston drive started with system 0m size??
isoimage - add verify iso to dolphin service menus??

live:
26. Ability to boot in text mode from grub
27. Add secondary keyboard layout into live sys (along with english and english by default) that was chosen in syslinux (F2) and on installed sys (lang chosen in calamares). ??
5. Launch full-fledged 'System Monitor' (KSysGuard) on Ctrl + Esc shortcut instead of stripped-down 'System Activity'.???
add firefox and dolphin app shortcuts into Icons-only Task Manager???
add comment use and modify kaos linux sddm theme it has user/keyboard layout/session select???
add test lock/logout widget test maybe add into livesys add notes calc widget ??
8. Add fastest mirror detection and synchronizing of databases upon connecting to internet. ???
12. Integrate Variety app - change wallpaper once a day (in addition to 'Picture of the Day' Wallpaper functionality) - preconfigure for anonimous login and select image sources like - nature - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/37 , digital art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/479 , fantasy art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/853 . It would be great to have different wallpapers on all Nerunner installations (with default wallpaper when offline or on first day), http://peterlevi.com/variety/2014/05/variety-and-kde/ , https://answers.launchpad.net/variety/+question/268006 . ????
9. Minor - kde system settings package without classic tree view option (like in calculate linux kde). ??
14. Bundle firefox (and chromium) with beyond australis, video downloadhelper (+ flashgot?), down them all, findbar tweak, https everywhere, privacy badger, speed tweaks (speedyfox) with recommended values and tab mix plus extensions (all preconfigured).??

kfind doesn't update file list after moving found files to trash retest???

kfind is taking to much cpu upon searching home folder

suggestion vision of a perfect distro - wishlist
i suggest here in comments add your thougts of what will make a perfect distro
checklist from other distros pros and cons
use blue theme bluex instead of dark brown/grey/blue by default - task switcher is using bluex theme already
OpenRC version.
6. Idea for disabling internal update checking/notification of all apps.
15. Develop Nurunner Tweaks app (like Lite Tweaks in Lite Linux) - for apps tweaks (and use kaptan for kde tweaks) - or all-in-one Nurunner Control Center with welcome screen.
advertize android development, gaming, QPhotoRec Qt5 GUI - alternative to Recuva etc. on main site + commercial support + buy subcription??
4. Build server for nightly isos, dev/git/AUR packages.
6. Think about more additional nurunner configurations (better plasma integrations, patches etc.) for some applications that can be installed separately (or as dependency, or in meta package). configuration for popular apps??
7. Idea - make installing apps in more assisted mode. For example you install plex-media-server and you see more tips in console, running plex server interface auto opens in default browser after installing.??
9. disable border in main panel and in GTK3 CSDs - for faster selection of apps with moving cursor to the most left position of app icon - for less congnitive load of more precise select of apps icon - for faster closing minimizing maximizing GTK3 windows without precise selection of buttons - for faster selection of window buttons with moving cursor to the most top position of GTK3 app window buttons
- sell t-shorts, cups, mobile straps?


11. Set middle mouse click on desktop to 'Switch Window' action by default
Right click on desktop -> Configure Desktop -> Mouse Actions -> Middle-Button -> Switch Window dropdown
This will ease of switching between numerous application on more than one virtual desktop. ??

[Suggestion] Tweak Dolphin
'Details' view mode with added 'Type' column,
    22px icons size
    bottom right slider screenshot +  + disable preview + show full path + dolphin enable more root actions dropbox services in options??
Various gadget to work greatly with netrunner - fitbit, nest...
5) better integration with various (sport, iot) gadgets, sport bands, watches
