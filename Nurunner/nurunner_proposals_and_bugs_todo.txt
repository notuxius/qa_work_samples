buildiso -p netrunner -k linux47
yaourt -S manjaro-tools-base manjaro-tools-iso manjaro-efi-shell manjaro-isolinux manjaro-iso-profiles-official --force


My steps:
    1. installed 'manjaro-tools-base manjaro-tools-iso manjaro-efi-shell manjaro-isolinux manjaro-iso-profiles-official' packages,
    2. downloaded nurunner's overlay from github, renamed /home/nurunner to /home/not (my user name) and copied files from it into system with merging folders and replacing files,
    3. copied netrunner profile into community folder in manjaro tools iso-profiles,
    4. moved all files from 'kde' folder up one level - into netrunner folder,
    5. renamed netrunner folder into nurunner,
    6. ran 'buildiso -p nurunner -k linux47',
    7. commented proprietary drivers in Packages-Mhwd and Packages-Mhwd-minimal
