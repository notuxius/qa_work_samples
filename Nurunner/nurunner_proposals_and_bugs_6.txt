Greetings!

1. Look at 'etcher' - utility for burning isos into usb/sd drives. Check out it's roadmap - https://github.com/resin-io/etcher/milestones . After adding these features it can be added to repo.
2. Add boomaga-qt5, smartgit, visual-studio-code, komodo-edit, yarock-qt5, webtorrent-desktop, ring-kde, wire-desktop, skypeforlinux (when it's mature, or ghetto-linux? mentioned before, or even skype in ice-ssb), vivaldi (when starting from console - getting following error - /etc/os-release: line 2: rolling: command not found - review '/etc/os-release' file) and brave packages into repo.
3. '¿Lost your password?' and '¿Don't have an account?' questions - both starts with inverted question marks in forum login window - like in spanish lang - is this ok? - and if you fail to login - you'll be redirected to this page - https://nurunner.org/forum/member.php - and here link beside password - '(Lost your password?)' - has no inverted question marks.
4. Look at 'Ultimate Boot CD' distro - http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ - it has many usefull utilities that can be selected and placed in live iso (and in repos too) in something like 'Additional' menu item in syslinux - for example utilites for wiping cmos, resetting win password, cpu/gpu burn tests, etc. - apps like memtest, hardwire detection tool and whdd can be placed there too.
5. Launch full-fledged 'System Monitor' (KSysGuard) on Ctrl + Esc shortcut instead of stripped-down 'System Activity'.
6. Idea for disabling internal update checking/notification of all apps.
7. Persistent storage option for booting in syslinux.
8. Add kshutdown app (or other gui shutdown utility) into live sys.
9. Supply 'System Monitor' with 'Simple Read and Write Hard Disk Information' tab by default from 'Get How New Stuff' (File - Download New Tabs...).
10. Create cname for http://nurunner.mkxt.net/ that points and emmideatelly redirects to http://nurunner.org/ .
11. 'Show this dialog on startup?' button doesn't toggling visually in welcome app (but the button actually adds and removes welcome app from autostart) + a lot of - 'Message: console message: file:///usr/share/nurunner-welcome/index.html @1: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $' - error messages when you launch welcome app from console and when you click 'Show this dialog at startup?' button.
12. Do not show updates from octopi on live sys - hide octopi entry in sys tray by default on live sys - do you need to know that updates available on live sys?
13. Allow only one instance of nurunner welcome app, don't launch it by default in live sys - create desktop icon for it.
14. Add android studio + sdk + apktool + support packages.. for android developement into repo.
15. Bundle chromium with chromium-widevine package for watching with Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) Content Decryption Module (Netflix etc.) - and add it into repo.
16. Include htop iotop and iftop by default in live sys
17. Standart app icon in main menu -> 'System' section and no icon for 'Nurunner Welcome' when you search for it in main menu (and no icon when you add it's shortcut to the desktop too).
18. 'Nurunner Welcome' app uses netrunner icon (in window and in task manager).
19. Submit Nurunner to Distrowatch - https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=submit
20. Bundle dropbox when it will be available in repo (and in live sys) with dropbox-plasma-dark-icons package + add it to repo + add dropbox-plasma-light-icons package into repo too - cause default dropbox icon is pixelated in sys tray (for me).
21. Make best firefox (chromium) exp - resolve 'updating addons compatibility' window appearance on startup in live sys - disable some functionality (like in light-firefox), add more privacy addons, more speedup addons, download manager (down them all), save video helper, etc. Think about best experience in other apps too (players, editors, viewers...). 
22. Too low quality of nurunner's background images in syslinux - noticeable compression artifacts.
23. No or custom (blue not green from manjaro like now) theme in linux kernel loading progressbar after choosing nurunner menu item in syslinux.
24. Disable current plasma loading animation with nurunner logo - make it static image - it's lagging a little bit even on i5 cpu.
25. Checkout Apricity Freezedry - https://twitter.com/ApricityOS/status/76...8981618688 - https://github.com/Apricity-OS/apricity-freezedry .
26. There are two readmes - one on desktop and one in welcome app - i sugest remove 'Readme' shortcut from desktop and make 'Read Me' in welcome app a link that points to nurunner website's readme (like 'Forums' and 'Get Involved' links) - or rename 'Read Me' in welcome app into 'About' or something - and if Read Me/About will not be a link - make ability to go back from it to the main/home section of the welcome app (maybe add 'Back ' button near current 'Close' button).
27. Nurunner's logo but 'Netrunner Menu' string on changing panel's widget (clicking on three bottom right lines on the panel in default position)- when you hover over application's menu icon.
28. Make top left 'Nurunner' text and logo image a link to main site in welcome app.
29. There's no non-rolling edition of distro - so 'Rolling' text in welcome app (and in systemd welcome message) can be changed to let's say 'Florence' - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres...p_25_women . Further releases can be named as best female runners at different distances.
30. Replace 'Expanding Icons Task Manager' with 'Icons-only Task Manager' with new instance on middle-click option - tweak desktop theme for it.
31. Add kgpg, kompare, kcharselect, filezilla, gnome-disk-utility, calibre, vym (with all toolbars enabled by default), redshift, enpass (or other password manager) and maybe some note taking app into live sys.
32. Enable dropbox, kompare, kgpg dolphin services be default (i like KaOs linux dolphin services).
33. Change bottom right screen edge behavior from 'Show Desktop' to 'Present Windows - All Desktops'.
34. Change alt tab visualization to compact (or to breeze).
35. Boot in verbose mode not in quite.
36. Add 'kcm-wacomtablet' package in repo and in live sys - gui for wacom tablet drivers.
37. Add kio-gdrive package into repo and live sys - for accessing google drive from dolphin - when it's become more mature - as for now i can't login into account from it.
38. 'Could not start process Cannot talk to klaucher: Not connected to D-Bus server' error if you want to save smart report in partitionmanager.
