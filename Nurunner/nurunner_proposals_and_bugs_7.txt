Salute!

1. Contact with major linux news sites, propose them to write about nurunner.
2. Add wmail (electron app for (g)mail), ricochet (im through tor network), tor-browser (+ lang packs), ttf-oxygen (firefox dependency), docfetcher, zeal (offline docs), demonsaw (sharing app, not in aur - https://www.demonsaw.com/ ), ramme (instagram desktop app, not in aur - https://terkelg.github.io/ramme/ ) and tomahawk-qt5 into repos.
3. Inconsistent color themes on nurunner's main website subdomains: https://nurunner.org/dev - dark blue, https://nurunner.org/forum/ - light blue, https://nurunner.org/ - more of black.
4. 'mlt_repository_init: failed to dlopen /usr/lib/mlt/libmltsox.so (libsox.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)' if you launch kdenlive from console - solution - presence of 'sox' package in live sys.
5. 'GEGL-geglmodule.c-Message: Module '/usr/lib/gegl-0.2/openraw.so' load error: libopenraw.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.
Failed to parse tag cache: No such file or directory' error on gimp startup from console - solution - presence of 'libopenraw' package in live sys.
6. 'ERROR plugin-load.cc:72 [plugin_load]: /usr/lib/audacious/Container/cue.so could not be loaded: libcue.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory' and 'ERROR plugin-load.cc:72 [plugin_load]: /usr/lib/audacious/Input/sid.so could not be loaded: libsidplayfp.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory' errors on audacious startup - solution - presence of 'libcue' and 'libsidplayfp' packages in live sys.
7. netrunner in server list in konversation.
8. Flickering of text in steam window when downloading initial update (on first launch) - on intel 4500mhd video card.
9. Minor - kde system settings package without classic tree view option (like in calculate linux kde).
10. ARM images.
11. Right click on desktop -> Configure desktop -> Mouse actions -> set vertical scroll to 'Switch Window' action (everything else not working for me).
12. Integrate variety - change wallpaper once a day - preconfigure for anonimous login and select image sources (nature - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/37 , digital art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/479 , fantasy art - https://alpha.wallhaven.cc/tag/853 ... ). It would be great to have different wallpapers on all nurunner installations (with default wallpaper when offline or on first day), http://peterlevi.com/variety/2014/05/variety-and-kde/ , https://answers.launchpad.net/variety/+question/268006 .
13. Ability to work with flatpak, snap, appimage applications without installing any additional packages on live sys.
14. Bundle firefox (and chromium) with beyond australis, video downloadhelper (+ flashgot?), down them all, findbar tweak, https everywhere, privacy badger, speed tweaks (speedyfox) with recommended values and tab mix plus extensions (all preconfigured).
15. Develop Nurunner Tweaks app (like Lite Tweaks in Lite Linux) - for apps tweaks (and use kaptan for kde tweaks) - or all-in-one Nurunner Control Center with welcome screen.
16. Gmusicbrowser still not working - replace it with gmusicbrowser-shimmer from aur, add flac123 (for flac support), vorbis-tools (for ogg support), perl-net-dbus packages and their dependencies into live iso, replace 'perl-glib-object-introspection' package in repo with one from aur (to make gmusicbrowser work).
17. Name distro as greatest challenges in the world - hardest marathons - https://weather.com/news/news/worlds-toughest-marathons-running-20121103#/1
18. OpenRC version.
19. Add nfoview, kchmviwer, wireshark-qt, kde remote desktop app - https://www.kde.org/applications/internet/krdc/ and veracrypt packages into live sys.
20. 'Failed to open VDPAU backend libvdpau_va_gl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory' error when started vlc from console and opened some video file - add libvdpau-va-gl package into iso.
21. KInfocenter -> About System -> Network -> Network Status -> {OnlineStatus} template instead of actual status info.
22. Use grub on live iso instead of syslinux - minimize differences between look and feel of installed and live systems.
23. Use lts kernel, lts kde, esr firefox, libreoffice still...
