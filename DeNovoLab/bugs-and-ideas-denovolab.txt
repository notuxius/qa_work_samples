MINOR - NOT RELEVANT

On main doc page - http://doc.denovolab.com/display/CLASv5d2 - link text mismatches from it's actual mailto: link address - in "or via e-mail to support@denovolab.com" text link - should i change link addres into "support@denovolab.com"?

- There are two contacts that can be found in Skype if you search for "dnl_support" name in Skype directory - perhaps second "dns.support" contact can be deleted - for less ambiguity for users that are searching for Skype support. - not app UI or docs relevant - minor

- "Agent" anchor not working in FAQ page - http://doc.denovolab.com:8090/display/5/Frequently+Asked+Questions - no write access - old version

- What do +0000 digits mean in timestamp on the top left side of the portal? - very minor

- Vertical scroll bar can be added in long main menu dropdown lists (specifically for "Log" menu item dropdown list) - reason - on 1366x768 resolution - the dropdown list is barely fits into the screen - and if user increases font size in browser - dropdown menu will no longer fit and access to lower dropdown list items will be confusing. - minor

- Pages in docs with no text in them and without any information - like "Page is currently under construction" or something like that: - future editing

8. No pictures in 3 circle placeholders at the bottom of the http://portal.denovolab.com/index.php page.

9. Misspelled word "developerment " and plural form of company word in text -

13. Misspelled word "thru" in "Finance" tab in text - "The system will only let the calls to pass thru if there is remaining credit." on http://www.denovolab.com/product page.

14. Two separate words "in case" are written without space between them in "Finance" tab in text "Support for providing adjustments incase of faulty invoicing, e.g. credit notes, debit notes" on http://www.denovolab.com/product page.

themer primary color - misleading cursor pointer


2. On this help page - http://doc.denovolab.com/display/CLASv5d2/Class4V5+First+Steps#Class4V5FirstSteps-NavigatingaroundtheUserInterface - section on the top right side is called "Admin Options"- but for example - on next help page - http://doc.denovolab.com/display/CLASv5d2/Getting+Help+and+Support - that section is called "user option" - and if you search for "user option" and "admin options" all across help pages - you'll notice usage both "user option" and "Admin Options" terms for same section - i think this is inconsistency in naming.

"Change Theme" option for Admin Options menu is not mentioned in help pages.

7. IDEA - Develop - two modes for http://192.99.10.113/ interface:
1) Normal - all will left the same like now
2) Educational - every acronym (or other parts of the site that can be not obvious for novice users) will be a link that leads to internal help page anchor with explanations for that acronym - or to wiki page - and a brief help info can be obtained by just hovering over that acronym link - also there can be a questions signs near not obvious parts of the site with explanations for them.

9. Option in Main Toolbar on http://192.99.10.113/ site - "Configuration -> Carrier Portal CDR Fields" - is different from "Configuration -> Carrier Portal Allow CDR Fields" specified in help page - http://doc.denovolab.com/display/CLASv5d2/Carrier+Portal+Allowed+CDR+Fields - there no "Allow" word in Main Toolbar.

skewed action buttons links on http://192.99.10.113/sysmodules/view_sysmodule

BUG""""""Theme that is displayed initially is not default one

Theme that is displayed initially is not default one and not one used in help section.

I think red color is more matching for errors messages and for bringing attention - but not for whole theme by default.

text in red pop-up messages is poorly readable - it lacks contrast and size - this is especially true for visually impaired users - http://192.99.10.113/sysrolepris/add_sysrolepri

redo this text "If not click on Reset button to reset all field and click on Back button to go back to Roles List page." - no need in clicking "Reset" as fields are not saving if just clicked "Back" button - http://192.99.10.113/sysrolepris/add_sysrolepri

maybe place "Back" button near "Submit" and "Reset" buttons - for users in order that the user does not have to scroll whole page up for pressing "Back" button to go back.
