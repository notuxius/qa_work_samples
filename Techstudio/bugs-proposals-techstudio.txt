Here are bugs and proposals for http://www.techstudio.tv/ page at first sight:

1. On http://www.techstudio.tv/careers/ page - 
"JOB TITLE", "LOCATION" and "PUBLISHED" table headers sections are not clickable - but with mouse cursor in pointer style when hovering over them - misleading for users.

2. On http://www.techstudio.tv/careers/ page - 
no need in dropdown with 'No additional info' text - because there is not additional info for every job in job table. 

3. On http://www.techstudio.tv/careers/ page - jobs table is
too small vertically - creating bad UX for users - 3-too-small-vertically-jobs-table.png screenshot.

4. Jobs table style colors (grey, black, orange) is not matching with other website style colors (blue, white, green).

5. 404 error page has overlapping text and no style in form at the top of the page - 5-techstudio-404-page-overlapping-text screenshot.

6. Facebook and Twitter links in the footer are just links to Facebook and Twitter homepages - which is meaningless - i think these links can be converted into Facebook and Twitter Techstudio page links.

7. On http://www.techstudio.tv/#contact_demo page - there is hard to read errors text.

8. On http://www.techstudio.tv/about-us/ page - should be extended to include info about company itself - and not only a brief description about technology - for better SEO and for customers reference.

9. On http://www.techstudio.tv/#contact_demo page - on mobile resolution - error 'One or more fields have an error. Please check and try again.' text div is shifted to the right side - 9-error-text-div-is-shifted-to-the-right-side screenshot.

10. 404 Not Found error for http://fonts.googleapis.com/ link - <link rel='dns-prefetch' href='//fonts.googleapis.com' /> - on homepage.

11. On http://www.techstudio.tv/faq/ page - in 'Technical Questions' tab - there are only 'Lorem ipsum' text dropdowns.

12. On http://www.techstudio.tv/faq/ page - there is no text in 'Service Related' and 'Questions' tabs.


Screenshots are attached.
